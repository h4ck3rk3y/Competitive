# Spoj
SPOJ (Sphere Online Judge) is an online judge system with over 200,000 registered users and over 20000 problems. 
A repository of all my successful Spoj code!
You can also create a backup of your Spoj Code using :

^ Not created by me. I found the tool on www.spoj.com/tools/
Had to make some changes for it to work on the new version of Spoj though.
Most of my code is crafted in C++ my language of choice in programming competitions!
Some variable names might be weird.
Expect weirder comments as questions sometimes are very frustrating.
