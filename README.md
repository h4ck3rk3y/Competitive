# Spoj
SPOJ (Sphere Online Judge) is an online judge system with over 200,000 registered users and over 20000 problems. 
This is a repository of all my successful Spoj submissions!
You can also create a backup of your Spoj Code using :<br>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/h4ck3rk3y/Spoj/blob/master/recipe-577036-1.py">Scraper!</a><br>
</li>
</ul>
The scraper has not been created by me. I found the tool on www.spoj.com/tools/
Had to make some changes for it to work on the new version of Spoj though.
Most of my code is crafted in C++ my language of choice in programming competitions!
Some variable names might be weird.
Expect weirder comments as questions sometimes are very frustrating.
